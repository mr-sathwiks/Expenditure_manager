This is a application where user will be able to track his monthly expence.
It works on the basis of collecting the data provided by the user either on a daily basis or at his disposal.

User will have to provide his openning balance for the 1st time he uses the application.

On regular window, user will enter his transaction with reson(statement) in specified slots (weather its recived or spent). When he 
enteres the data it is TIME stamped or user specified data & saved onto a SQL database, to form a regular ledgure.

The database will conatain multiple columns as (slnos, date, perpouse, amount recived/spent, daily balance) . 
Depending on the data input final balance will also be calulated, where the final balance will be used as the opening balance of next month & so on.

The database will contain multiple tables, where each table is for a single month (backend work to creat new table for every new month).

Addisional fetures are, links such as opening the database file for complete veiw should be given, also a link to just display the avilable balance also.

All this functionalities with a proper GUI.
